 *  SYNOPSIS

 *      #include <Bmath.hpp>
 *      double qtukey(p, rr, cc, df, lower_tail, log_p);
 *
 *  DESCRIPTION
 *
 *      Computes the quantiles of the maximum of rr studentized
 *      ranges, each based on cc means and with df degrees of freedom
 *      for the standard error, is less than q.
 *
 *      The algorithm is based on that of the reference.
